## What is Dinokiki? 
Dinokiki is an interactive website with one purpose: have fun!!!
Turn your audio on and click on the Dinosaur and get ready!
Everytime you click over him a jQuery function randomly calls one of the kikis.

## How was it developed? 
It uses HTML5, Sass, jQuery, PHP (CodeIgniter) and MySQL. It's responsive.
Dinokiki changes its style for some special dates such as halloween, christmas and his birthday. Sass is very helpful on these changes.

No. It changes constantly and you can help if you want :D
