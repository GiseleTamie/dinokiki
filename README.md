#DINOKIKI

##What is Dinokiki? 
Dinokiki is an interactive website with one purpose: have fun!!!
Turn your audio on and click on the Dinosaur and get ready!
Everytime you click over him a jQuery function randomly calls one of the kikis.

##How was it developed? 
It uses HTML5, Sass and jQuery. It is mobile friendly.
Dinokiki changes its style for some special dates such as halloween and christmas. Sass is very helpful on these changes.

##Will Dinokiki always be the same? 
No. It will have more features such as a kiki simulator, where you can upload and test your own kiki audio file instantly. Just wait!

##Can I help?
Sure! If you have any idea, want to send a kiki or just want to say hi send me a message.
